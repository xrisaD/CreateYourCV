# CreateYourCV
Create a perfect CV website in just a few steps.

All you have to do is to update the files/directories with files start from "data". More specifically, "data.css" and "data.json".
"data.css" file contains color parameters and the main image of your CV.
"data.json" file contains all the text infomation that your CV will contain. 
Moreover, all the necessary photo should be placed in ./cv/images folder.

### Step 2: 
Let's start with "data.json". 
The available tags you will see are the following: components, about me, timeline, projects, skills, languages and contact me.

- "components": a list with the components that your CV will have. The available values that the list should contains are: "about me", "timeline", "skills", "languages", "projects", "contact me anonymously" and "contact me". The order you place the tags is the same order that the components will appear.
- "about_me": constists of two subcomponents, "heading" and "details". 

### Step 2: 
Choose 3 colors and update the src/App.css file.
### Step 3:
Put your images in the src/images directory
